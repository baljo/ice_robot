# Ice Robot Tutorial

## The Problem
Too many persons get injured (or worse) due to icy conditions. Typically the city or state is responsible for ensuring public roads are safe to use, but the responsibility moves to you at the start of your own driveway. You can of course salt or sand your icy driveway manually, similarly as you can mow your lawn manually, vacuum your home manually, doing the dishes, etc. Curing your driveway from ice might be fun or tedious, if tedious then this Ice Beat-Le rover is for you.

## The Solution

Meat Ice Beat-Le, a symphatethic looking 6-wheel rover which spreads salt, sand, or any other material on your driveway or lawn. It has IR-eyes locking in on an IR-Beacon transmitting a 38 kHz signal of varying intensity.
