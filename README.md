# Ice Robot Tutorial

## The Problem
Too many persons get injured (or worse) due to icy conditions. Typically the city or state is responsible for ensuring public roads are safe to use, but the responsibility moves to you at the start of your own driveway. You can of course salt or sand your icy driveway manually, similarly as you can mow your lawn manually, vacuum your home manually, doing the dishes, etc. Curing your driveway from ice might be fun or tedious, if tedious then this Ice Beat-Le rover is for you.
